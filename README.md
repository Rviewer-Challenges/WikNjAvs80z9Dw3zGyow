# RateIT

RateIt is an application for rating IT courses and educators to help people who want to learn, making it easier for them to find the best education for them.

You can see the final result [here](https://rateit-v1.vercel.app/).

## Build with

- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [ReactJs](https://es.reactjs.org/)
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)


I didn't have a lot of time to work on the project and I haven't had time to test it and there are some parts of the code that could be cleaner, but I'm happy with the final result.

You will need the Firebase API key to run it locally, ask me for it.
